# This file is a fix for this issue with django-compressor
# https://github.com/django-compressor/django-compressor/issues/226

# This is a less filter that explicitly calls CssAbsoluteFilter.

# After adding the relative-urls flag to the lessc command,
# it appears to be unnecessary but I'm leaving it here in case
# we need it later for other deployment setups.
